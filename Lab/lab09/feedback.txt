1) compiles, but I get a core dump when trying to run the binary:

malloc.c:2401: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == initial_top (av) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= MINSIZE && prev_inuse (old_top) && ((unsigned long) old_end & (pagesize - 1)) == 0)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

to fix, in constructor change 
*(_p+userNumber) = 0;
to
*(_p+i) = 0;

2) using wrong form of 'delete' in destructor, need 'delete []'.
3) main() needs some commments.
